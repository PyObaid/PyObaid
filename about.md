In 2016 I joined the [Computational EM Lab](http://www.compem.ece.mcgill.ca/) at McGill University to conduct research in numerical algorithms design & analysis for my master's degree. I developed Finite Element (FE) algorithms to solve probelms with complex geometry more efficiently. 

In 2017 I started working as a software developer at [MicrowaveSoft](http://microwavesoft.com/), a startup company that specializes in telecommunication services and products. 

In 2019 I joined [Cerence Inc.](https://www.cerence.com/) as Software QA Analyst working on coversational AI assistants for the automotive industry. 

I'm interested in Computer Science, Prorgamming languages, algorithms design and analysis.
